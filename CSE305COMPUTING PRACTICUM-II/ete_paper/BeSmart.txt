Using a manual method (i.e. create/modify files by hand), configure a network connection on the primary network device with IP address 192.168.0.241/24, gateway 192.168.0.1, and nameserver 192.168.0.1:

vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s3
systemctl restart NetworkManager.service
# add line IPADDR=192.168.0.241
# add line GATEWAY=192.168.0.1
# add line DNS=192.168.0.1
# add line PREFIX=24
# change BOOTPROTO from dhcp to none
ifup enp0s3
nmcli con show # validate



Create user accounts called user10, user20, and user30. Set their passwords to Temp1234. Make accounts for user10 and user30 to expire on December 31, 2021:

useradd user10
useradd user20
useradd user30
passwd user10 # enter password
passwd user20 # enter password
passwd user30 # enter password
chage -E 2021-12-31 user10
chage -E 2021-12-31 user30
chage -l user10 # confirm


Create a user account called user40 with UID 2929. Set the password to user1234:

useradd -u 2929 user40
passwd user40 # enter password



Create a directory called dir1 under /tmp with ownership and owning groups set to root. Configure default ACLs on the directory and give user user10 read, write, and execute permissions:

mkdir /tmp/dir1
cd /tmp
# tmp already has ownership with root
setfacl -m u:user10:rwx dir1



Use tar and bzip2 to create a compressed archive of the /etc/sysconfig directory. Store the archive under /tmp as etc.tar.bz2:

tar -cvzf /tmp/etc.tar.bz2 /etc/sysconfig



Change group membership on /mnt/mnt1 to group10. Set read/write/execute permissions on /mnt/mnt1 for group members, and revoke all permissions for public:

chgrp group10 /mnt/mnt1 
chmod 770 /mnt/mnt1



sing the nmcli command, configure a network connection on the primary network device with IP address 192.168.0.242/24, gateway 192.168.0.1, and nameserver 192.168.0.1:

nmcli con add ifname enp0s3 con-name mycon type ethernet ip4 192.168.0.242/24 gw4 192.168.0.1 ipv4.dns "192.168.0.1"
# man nmcli-examples can be referred to if you forget format
nmcli con show mycon | grep ipv4 # confirm


Create a user account called user70 with UID 7000 and comments "I am user70". Set the maximum allowable inactivity for this user to 30 days:

useradd -u 7000 -c "I am user70" user70
chage -I 30 user70



Create a file called testfile1 under /tmp with ownership and owning group set to root. Configure access ACLs on the file and give user10 read and write access. Test access by logging in as user10 and editing the file:

useradd user10
passwd user10 # set password
touch /tmp/testfile1
cd /tmp
setfacl -m u:user10:rw testfile1
sudo su user10
vi /tmp/testfile1 # can edit the file




Add a group called group20 and change group membership on /mnt/lvfs1 to group20. Set read/write/execute permissions on /mnt/lvfs1 for the owner and group members, and no permissions for others:

groupadd group20
chgrp group20 -R /mnt/lvfs1
chmod 770 -R /mnt/lvfs1


Use tar and gzip to create a compressed archive of the /usr/local directory. Store the archive under /tmp using a filename of your choice:

tar -czvf /tmp/local.tar.gz /usr/local



Search for all files in the entire directory structure that have been modified in the past 30 days and save the file listing in the /var/tmp/modfiles.txt file:

find / -mtime -30 >> /var/tmp/modfiles.txt


Lock user account user70. Use regular expressions to capture the line that shows the lock and store the output in file /tmp/user70.lock:

usermod -L user70
grep user70 /etc/shadow >> /tmp/user70.lock # observe
